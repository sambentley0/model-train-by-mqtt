# üöÇ ESP32 WiFi Train Controller

This project is an ESP32-based controller for OO gauge model trains, using MQTT for fully wireless operation. The system drives a DC motor through a DRV8871 H-bridge motor driver, powered by track-supplied 12V DC.  

---

## ‚ú® Features

- WiFi-controlled over MQTT
- Speed control (0‚Äì255)
- Direction control (forward / reverse / stop)
- Configurable max speed
- Configurable acceleration ramp
- Friendly train name with storage in flash
- Bridge rectifier for polarity protection
- Status reporting (speed and direction)
- Secure MQTT connection (username/password)
- OTA-friendly and modular

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Components

- ESP32 development board  
- DRV8871 motor driver  
- Buck converter (12V to 5V)  
- 1000uF 25V capacitor  
- Bridge rectifier (MB6S, KBP206 or 4x 1N5819 diodes)  
- 12V DC from track

### Notes

- Always use a common ground between ESP32, buck converter, and DRV8871  
- The bridge rectifier guarantees polarity protection if the train is rotated on the track  
- Capacitor smoothing improves performance over dirty rail sections  
- 25V capacitor is recommended for voltage headroom  
- Use appropriate wire gauges and strain relief

## üõ∞Ô∏è MQTT Broker Setup (Raspberry Pi)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Mosquitto

sudo apt update
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients

Enable and start it:

sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
sudo systemctl start mosquitto

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add a user for secure connections

Create a new user (for example, trainuser) with a password:

sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd trainuser

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Mosquitto

Edit the Mosquitto config file:

sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

Add these lines to the bottom:

allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd
listener 1883

Restart Mosquitto to apply changes:

sudo systemctl restart mosquitto

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the broker

Open two terminals on the Pi (or any PC with Mosquitto clients installed):

Terminal 1 (subscribe):

mosquitto_sub -h localhost -u trainuser -P yourpassword -t "test/topic"

Terminal 2 (publish):

mosquitto_pub -h localhost -u trainuser -P yourpassword -t "test/topic" -m "hello world"

‚úÖ You should see 'hello world' appear in Terminal 1.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the ESP32

Add to secrets.h on the ESP32:

const char* mqtt_user = "trainuser";
const char* mqtt_pass = "yourpassword";

And in your sketch‚Äôs reconnect() function, use:

if (client.connect(train_id, mqtt_user, mqtt_pass)) {

‚úÖ This will securely connect to your Pi‚Äôs broker with username/password protection.

## üõ∞Ô∏è MQTT Topics

Each train uses a unique short code based on its ESP32 MAC address, for example train/7F4D/.

| Purpose            | Topic                                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Speed command      | train/7F4D/speed                          |
| Direction command  | train/7F4D/direction                      |
| Status reporting   | train/7F4D/status                         |
| Name announce      | train/7F4D/name                           |
| Config friendlyname| train/7F4D/config/friendlyname            |
| Config maxspeed    | train/7F4D/config/maxspeed                |
| Config accelrate   | train/7F4D/config/accelrate               |
